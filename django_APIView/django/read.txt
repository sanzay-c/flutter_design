# Api is used to GET and POST the data
    --- from rest_framework.views import APIView 
    with the help of APIView

    ** APIView: You manually define the logic for handling different
        HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) 
        by writing individual methods for each one 
        (e.g., get(), post(), etc.).

    ** ViewSet: A ViewSet is much more automatic. 
        You donâ€™t have to define methods for each HTTP verb yourself. 
        Instead, DRF provides a set of default actions like list(), 
        create(), retrieve(), update(), and destroy() to handle the 
        standard CRUD operations, making your code more concise.
