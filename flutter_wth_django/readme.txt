    and to activate the env the command is 'env\Scripts\env'.

* what is serializer?
    serializers are like translators: they help turn data into a format 
    that can be shared and used across different systems or devices, 
    and they also help turn incoming data into something your app can understand.

    The purpose of serializers is to facilitate the 
    process of serialization (converting data into a format that
    can be rendered or transmitted) and 
    deserialization (converting incoming data from JSON or 
    other formats back into Python objects).

* Meta:
    The Meta class inside a serializer is a special class that provides 
    configuration options for how the serializer should behave. 
    It's used to tell DRF which model to work with, 
    which fields to include or exclude,
    and other settings related to the serializer's behavior.
